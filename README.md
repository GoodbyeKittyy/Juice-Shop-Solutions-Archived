# OWASP Juice Shop CTF Write-Up Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to providing comprehensive write-ups for the OWASP Juice Shop CTF challenges. OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure web application designed for training, demonstrating, and testing security tools and techniques. This repository aims to offer step-by-step solutions, detailed descriptions of vulnerabilities exploited, and recommended remediations for each challenge.

## Repository Structure

- **Challenges**: Solutions are organized into folders based on their difficulty level, ranging from 1 to 6 stars (⭐-⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐). Each challenge's folder contains a detailed write-up that walks through the approach taken to exploit vulnerabilities and secure the application.
  
- **Scripts**: This folder contains all scripts and automation tools developed and used to solve the Juice Shop challenges.

- **Assets**: All images used in the individual challenge write-ups are stored in this folder. These images illustrate the steps, results, and important concepts discussed in the write-ups.

- **Files**: Contains all files downloaded from the Juice Shop website during the challenges. These files were obtained as part of solving various challenges and are used to illustrate or explain certain solutions.

- **all_achievements.json**: This file is a backup of the progression state in the Juice Shop CTF, which, when applied, automatically validates most of the challenges. It is provided for reference and learning purposes.

## Recommendations

- **Companion Guide**: We highly recommend following along with the [official OWASP Juice Shop companion guide](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/) for additional context and explanations that complement these write-ups.

- **Self-Attempt Before Reference**: While this repository is a valuable resource, we encourage you to attempt solving the challenges on your own before consulting the write-ups. This approach will maximize your learning experience and understanding of web application security.

## Usage

To use this repository effectively, navigate to the challenge folder corresponding to your current challenge, read the write-up to understand the vulnerability and the remediation steps, and refer to the scripts, assets, or files as needed. Adjust the "all_achievements.json" to your environment to track or restore your progress.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the write-ups, scripts, or any other resources in this repository are welcome. Please submit pull requests with your suggested changes or enhancements.
